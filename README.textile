h1. swKnights - PLP

*This is a repository held together by some random students of the Principles of Programming Languages Course @ PoliMi, to share some exercises and code snippets written in the most exotic programming language you may think about!*

Don't expect to find anything useful - or even anything working - in this repository... they're just random experiments :)
